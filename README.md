# Cardboard Cards

A somewhat balanced, work-in-progress Balatro mod (also my first mod ever).

Requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) (note: Talisman may also be required in the future if I go crazy enough.)

So far this adds:

## FAQ

***I found a bug or some other issue, what do I do?***

Please report bugs and issues in the Issues tab, I'm still new to modding and Lua and I appreciate all the help I can get from people!

***Is this mod compatible with Cryptid/Extra Credit/insert mod here?***

This mod is ***not*** focused on compatibility with other mods and probably won't be until 1.0 has been released. If it works with the mods you use, that's great! If it doesn't, then feel free to report the crashes, but know that those issues will likely be ignored by me.

Jokers and other things that are known to be incompatible with a specific mod right now are marked in their description in red.

***How much content is planned to be added to this mod?***

I don't have high hopes for this project to grow as big as Cryptid, so my goals right now are to have at least 25 jokers and more than two consumables lol.
I do hope this project reaches 1.0 someday.
